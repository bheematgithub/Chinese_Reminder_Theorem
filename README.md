# Chinese Remainder Theorem Calculator

The Chinese Remainder Theorem provides a way to find an unknown number that satisfies several simultaneous congruences with pairwise coprime moduli. It guarantees a unique solution modulo the product of these moduli

## Key Points

- **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
  - The script calculates the product of all moduli.
  - For each congruence, it computes the modular inverse of the quotient of the product by the modulus.
  - It then constructs the solution step by step, showing each intermediate result.

- **Error Handling:**
  - The script checks for non-integer inputs and reports errors accordingly.
  - It alerts the user if a modular inverse does not exist for any modulus, indicating an issue with the input values.

- **Output:**
  - The script displays each intermediate calculation, including the modular inverses and the final solution.
  - The final result is presented both as an absolute value and modulo the product of the moduli.

## Sample Output

Here is an example of the output generated by the script:
```
Total no of elements = 3

n1 = 3
x1 = 4

n2 = 4
x2 = 5

n3 = 5
x3 = 6

a1 = 60/3 = 20
a2 = 60/4 = 15
a3 = 60/5 = 12

alpha1 => 2 * 20 = 1 mod 3
alpha2 => 3 * 15 = 1 mod 4
alpha3 => 3 * 12 = 1 mod 5

 x = (4*20*2) + 5*15*3 + (6*12*3) mod 60 
 x = (160) + 225 + (216) mod 60 
 x = 601 mod 60 
 x = 1
```
